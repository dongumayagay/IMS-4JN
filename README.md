# To run this code on your computer

> You should have **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** and **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**  installed on your computer

1.  Clone this repo by typing the following to your cmd/terminal/bash/powershell/etc
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dongumayagay/IMS-4JN
    ```
    Next after the repo is done cloning, move to the project directory by typing the following to your cmd/terminal/bash/powershell/etc
    ```
    cd IMS-4JN
    ```
3. Now that your are in the project directory you have to install the packages the project need.

    I prefer to insall package using pnpm. To install **pnpm**(if you don't have it already install)

    type in your cmd/terminal/bash/powershell/etc
    ```
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

    installing packages using pnpm type
    ```
    pnpm install
    ```
4. Now that it's ready to run on your computer just type
    ```
    pnpm run dev
    ```
